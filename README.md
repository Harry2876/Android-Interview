**1\. Android SDK & Kotlin**

**Core Knowledge to Highlight:**

‚Ä¢Familiarity with Android components: Activity, Fragment, and Services.

‚Ä¢Understanding Android architecture: ViewModel, LiveData.

‚Ä¢Proficiency in Kotlin syntax and key features: coroutines, extension functions, null safety.

**Example Question:**

**Q:** ‚ÄúHow do coroutines improve Android app performance?‚Äù

**A:** Coroutines simplify threading by avoiding callbacks, enabling tasks like network calls to run asynchronously without blocking the main thread.

**Quick Learning:**

‚Ä¢Revisit the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/).

‚Ä¢Explore Kotlin coroutines via [this guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines).

**2\. WebRTC**

**Core Knowledge to Highlight:**

‚Ä¢Peer-to-peer communication using RTCPeerConnection.

‚Ä¢Steps for setting up WebRTC: Signaling, ICE candidates, and media streams.

‚Ä¢Common use cases: Video calls, screen sharing.

**Example Question:**

**Q:** ‚ÄúHow does WebRTC handle real-time video calls?‚Äù

**A:** WebRTC uses RTCPeerConnection for establishing a peer-to-peer connection, and MediaStream for sharing audio/video between clients. It relies on signaling servers to exchange ICE candidates and session descriptions.

**Quick Learning:**

‚Ä¢Check out [WebRTC samples](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/).

**3\. Socket.IO**

**Core Knowledge to Highlight:**

‚Ä¢Event-driven communication between client and server.

‚Ä¢Common methods: emit() for sending data, on() for receiving data.

‚Ä¢Real-world examples: Chat apps, live notifications.

**Example Question:**

**Q:** ‚ÄúWhat are the benefits of using Socket.IO for real-time communication?‚Äù

**A:** Socket.IO abstracts WebSocket complexities, provides fallback for unsupported browsers, and supports features like broadcasting and room-based messaging.

**4\. Dagger (Dependency Injection)**

**Core Knowledge to Highlight:**

‚Ä¢Why use Dependency Injection (DI): For scalability, testability, and reduced coupling.

‚Ä¢Key components in Dagger:

‚Ä¢@Module: Provides dependencies.

‚Ä¢@Component: Connects dependencies.

‚Ä¢@Inject: Marks where dependencies are required.

‚Ä¢Scopes: Singleton, Activity, Fragment.

**Example Question:**

**Q:** ‚ÄúHow does Dagger enhance scalability in Android?‚Äù

**A:** Dagger automatically resolves dependencies, making the code modular and easier to maintain, especially in large-scale projects.

**Quick Learning:**

‚Ä¢Follow the [Dagger for Android](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/dagger-basics) guide.

**5\. Epoxy**

**Core Knowledge to Highlight:**

‚Ä¢A library for managing RecyclerViews using models.

‚Ä¢Benefits:

‚Ä¢Avoids writing boilerplate code for adapters.

‚Ä¢Handles multiple view types efficiently.

‚Ä¢Key concepts: EpoxyModel, EpoxyController.

**Example Question:**

**Q:** ‚ÄúHow does Epoxy simplify RecyclerView management?‚Äù

**A:** Epoxy abstracts RecyclerView adapters and lets you define UI as models, making it easy to update and maintain.

**Quick Learning:**

**6\. MVVM**

**Core Knowledge to Highlight:**

‚Ä¢Separation of concerns: View handles UI, ViewModel handles logic, Model provides data.

‚Ä¢LiveData for two-way data binding.

‚Ä¢Integration with other Jetpack components like Room and Navigation.

**Example Question:**

**Q:** ‚ÄúWhy is MVVM preferred in modern Android development?‚Äù

**A:** It provides a clear separation of UI and business logic, improves code maintainability, and works seamlessly with Jetpack libraries.

**Quick Learning:**

‚Ä¢Review [Google‚Äôs MVVM guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide).

**7\. Firebase**

**Core Knowledge to Highlight:**

‚Ä¢Realtime Database for syncing data across devices.

‚Ä¢Authentication for managing user login.

‚Ä¢Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.

**Example Question:**

**Q:** ‚ÄúHow would you use Firebase for real-time chat?‚Äù

**A:** By using Firebase Realtime Database to store and sync messages across clients instantly, and Firebase Authentication to manage users.

**Quick Learning:**

‚Ä¢Visit the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs).
