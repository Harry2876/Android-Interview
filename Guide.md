**1\. Overview of Key Topics**
------------------------------

### **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**

-   **What it is**: A technology enabling real-time peer-to-peer communication (audio, video, and data).
-   **Why it's used**: Often for video conferencing, live streaming, or chat applications.
-   **Key components**:
    -   **PeerConnection**: Handles audio/video streams between peers.
    -   **MediaStream**: Represents streams of media data.
    -   **Signaling**: Exchanging metadata (via Socket.io, for instance) to establish connections.

### **Socket.io**

-   **What it is**: A library for real-time bidirectional communication.
-   **Why it's used**: Useful for chat applications, real-time notifications, and gaming.
-   **Key terms**:
    -   Events: `on`, `emit` for communication.
    -   Namespaces and Rooms: Organize sockets into groups.

### **Dagger**

-   **What it is**: A dependency injection framework for Android.
-   **Why it's used**: To reduce boilerplate code for dependencies, ensure scalability, and improve testability.
-   **Key terms**:
    -   Modules: Provide dependencies.
    -   Components: Bridge between modules and classes needing dependencies.

### **Epoxy**

-   **What it is**: A library for building complex RecyclerView layouts.
-   **Why it's used**: Makes RecyclerView management easier and more modular.

### **RecyclerView**

-   **What it is**: A ViewGroup for displaying large sets of data efficiently.
-   **Key terms**: Adapter, ViewHolder, DiffUtil.

### **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**

-   **What it is**: An architecture pattern that separates UI logic (View) from business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model).
-   **Why it's used**: Makes code cleaner and testable.

**3\. 100 Practice Questions with Answers**
-------------------------------------------

### **WebRTC**

1.  **What are the key components of WebRTC?**
    -   Answer: PeerConnection, MediaStream, signaling, and data channels.
2.  **How does WebRTC signaling work?**
    -   Answer: Exchanging session metadata (SDP and ICE candidates) via a signaling server.

### **Socket.io**

1.  **What is the difference between `on` and `emit`?**
    -   Answer: `on` listens for events, and `emit` triggers events.
2.  **How do you handle reconnections in Socket.io?**
    -   Answer: Use built-in reconnection strategies or custom logic with listeners.
